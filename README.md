# Peace Per Diem

## What?
A Twitter (ugh, X) clone that I made for my extended family during the early days of COVID. The 'per diem' part is the differentiator from other platforms--users are only allowed to submit one post ("peace") per day. 
Users can like as many other posts as they please and there is no "downvote". A simple ranking algorithm determines post viewership and is based on number of likes that decays with time.
